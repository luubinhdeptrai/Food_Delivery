# 🍔 SoLi Food Delivery Platform

SoLi is a modern, high-performance, and robust Food Ordering & Delivery platform. It provides a complete ecosystem for customers to order food, restaurants to manage their menus and operations, and administrators to oversee platform analytics and payouts.

Built as a **Monorepo** using Turborepo, it strictly adheres to scalable architectural patterns (like CQRS and Event-Driven snapshots for core domains) and utilizes a state-of-the-art technology stack.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend (`apps/web`)
* **Framework:** React / Vite (TypeScript)
* **Design System:** Custom "Stitch Design System" using Tailwind CSS (`oklch` color spaces, glassmorphism, fluid typography).
* **UI Components:** Shadcn UI, Base UI (headless accessibility).
* **Data Fetching:** React Query (TanStack Query) & `react-hook-form` with Zod validation.
* **Mapping & Visuals:** `react-leaflet` (Leaflet.js), `recharts` for analytics.

### Backend (`apps/api`)
* **Framework:** NestJS (TypeScript)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL managed via Drizzle ORM.

* **APIs:** Comprehensive REST endpoints for menus, restaurants, geocoding, and user sessions.

### Infrastructure & Tooling
* **Monorepo:** Turborepo (`pnpm` workspaces)
* **Cloud Services:** Cloudinary (Images), Photon API (Geocoding)
