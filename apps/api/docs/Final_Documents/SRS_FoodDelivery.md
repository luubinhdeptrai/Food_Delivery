## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional requirements for Phase 1 of the **SoLi Food Delivery** application. It serves as the authoritative reference for system behavior shared between design, development, QA, and stakeholder review.

### 1.2 Scope

Phase 1 covers the complete end-to-end ordering flow:
- User authentication and session management
- Restaurant and food discovery
- Cart management and checkout
- Delivery zone configuration
- Order placement and VNPay online payment
- Order history and reorder

Out of scope for Phase 1: driver tracking, restaurant dashboard analytics, loyalty programs, multi-language support, and the customer address book.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

| Audience               | Usage                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business Analysts      | Validate requirements against business goals                   |
| Developers             | Implementation reference for each functional area              |
| QA Engineers           | Test case derivation from Business Rules                       |
| Product Owners         | Sprint planning and acceptance criteria                        |

### 1.4 Document Conventions

- Use cases are prefixed `UC-N` (e.g., `UC-1`, `UC-8`).
- Business Rules are identified by domain-coded keys (e.g., `BR-AUTH-1`, `BR-8.4`).
- Activity Diagram steps use stable sequential numbering `(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)`, …. Each diagram has exactly **one** end node; both success and error branches converge at this single `stop`.
- Step references in the Business Rules table Activity column use italic parenthetical notation, e.g., _(3)_, _(4)–(5)_.
- Message Rules tables list every customer- or actor-visible message produced by a UC. Codes follow the pattern `MSG-<DOMAIN>-<NN>` (e.g., `MSG-AUTH-01`, `MSG-ORD-13`). Business Rules reference codes only; full message content lives exclusively in the Message Rules table.
- The symbol ❖ introduces a main business rule bullet; ● introduces a sub-item; ➢ introduces a nested detail.

### 1.5 Notation

| Symbol / Format | Meaning                                              |

| `'value'`       | Exact string enumeration value (e.g., `'pending'`)   |
| `[field]`       | Variable or data field                               |
| ❖               | Primary business rule bullet                         |
| ●               | Sub-item under a primary bullet                      |
| ➢               | Nested detail under a sub-item                       |
| **Bold**        | Rule-type label within a description cell            |
| `HTTP NNN`      | HTTP status code                                     |

### UC-1: User Authentication

| Name            | User Authentication                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description** | This use case describes how users register, sign in, recover their password, sign out, and how the system validates sessions on protected endpoints. |
| **Actor**       | Guest (unauthenticated user), Authenticated User                                    |
| **Trigger**     | ❖ Guest navigates to the Sign In or Sign Up page. ❖ User clicks "Logout". ❖ System receives a request to a protected endpoint with a Bearer token. |
| **Pre-condition** | ❖ For Sign In / Forgot Password: a valid user account exists. ❖ For Sign Up: no duplicate email exists in the system. |
| **Post-condition** | ❖ Sign Up / Sign In: a session is created and the user is redirected to the home page. ❖ Logout: the session is invalidated. ❖ Session Validation: the request proceeds with the authenticated user context. |

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(3)–(4)_ | _BR-AUTH-1_ | **Validate Rules (Sign In):** ❖ `email` is required and must be a valid email format. ❖ `password` is required and non-empty. ❖ If any required field is missing or malformed, system rejects the request with HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-AUTH-03`. |
| _(7)_ | _BR-AUTH-2_ | **Sign In Failure Rules:** ❖ If email is not found, password is incorrect, or account is banned, system returns HTTP 401 referencing `MSG-AUTH-01`. ❖ The system makes no distinction between failure causes to prevent user enumeration attacks. |
| _(5)_ | _BR-AUTH-3_ | **Session Creation Rules:** ❖ A session record is created with `expiresAt = now + sessionTtl` (default 7 days). ❖ `ipAddress` and `userAgent` are stored for audit purposes. ❖ Session token is returned in the HTTP response and used as a Bearer token on all subsequent requests. |
| _(8)–(9)_ | _BR-AUTH-4_ | **Validate Rules (Sign Up):** ❖ `name` must be a non-empty string. ❖ `email` must be a valid email format. ❖ `password` must be at least 8 characters and contain at least one letter and one digit. ❖ Invalid input returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-AUTH-03`. |
| _(12)_ | _BR-AUTH-5_ | **Sign Up Duplicate Email Rules:** ❖ If the email is already registered, system returns HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-AUTH-02`. |
| _(10)_ | _BR-AUTH-6_ | **Account Initialization Rules:** ❖ New accounts are created with `role = 'user'`. ❖ Elevation to `'restaurant'`, `'shipper'`, or `'admin'` is handled in Phase 2/Phase 4 flows. ❖ Passwords are stored as secure hashes; plaintext is never persisted. |
| _(14)–(15)_ | _BR-AUTH-7_ | **Forgot Password Rules:** ❖ System creates a verification record with a single-use OTP valid for 60 minutes. ❖ System responds HTTP 200 referencing `MSG-AUTH-04` regardless of whether the email exists (anti-enumeration). ❖ The OTP is dispatched via the configured channel (email / SMS). |
| _(17)_ | _BR-AUTH-8_ | **Logout Rules:** ❖ The session record is deleted immediately. ❖ Any subsequent requests using the invalidated token receive HTTP 401 referencing `MSG-AUTH-05`. |
| _(all protected routes)_ | _BR-AUTH-9_ | **Session Validation Rules:** ❖ Every protected endpoint requires a valid non-expired Bearer token. ❖ Missing or expired token returns HTTP 401 referencing `MSG-AUTH-05`. ❖ The session's associated user is attached to the request context. |
| _(6)_, _(11)_, _(18)_ | _BR-AUTH-10_ | **Redirect Rules:** ❖ Successful Sign In and Sign Up redirect to the home page. ❖ Successful Logout redirects to the sign-in page. |

#### Message Rules

| Message Code | Message Content | Button |
|---|---|---|
| MSG-AUTH-01 | Invalid email or password. | OK |
| MSG-AUTH-02 | User with this email already exists. | OK |
| MSG-AUTH-03 | Invalid input. Please check the form fields. | OK |
| MSG-AUTH-04 | If the email exists, a reset code has been sent. | OK |
| MSG-AUTH-05 | Unauthorized. | OK |

@enduml
```

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(3)_, _(6)_ | _BR-2.1_ | **Validate Rules:** ❖ `lat` and `lon` must be provided together. If only one is present, system returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-DISC-01`. ❖ `radiusKm` (if supplied) must be a positive number. |
| _(4)_ | _BR-2.2_ | **Pagination Rules:** ❖ `limit` is clamped to [1, 100]. `offset` is clamped to ≥ 0. ❖ Requests outside these bounds are accepted with clamped values (no error). |
| _(4)_ | _BR-2.3_ | **Restaurant Filter Rules:** ❖ Only restaurants with `isApproved = true` AND `isOpen = true` are included in results. ❖ If `lat`, `lon`, and `radiusKm` are provided, only restaurants within the specified radius are returned. |
| _(4)_ | _BR-2.4_ | **Item Filter Rules:** ❖ Only items with `status = 'available'` are included. ❖ The items array is populated only when at least one of `q`, `category`, or `tag` is provided; otherwise `items: []` is returned. |
| _(4)_ | _BR-2.5_ | **Relevance Scoring Rules:** ❖ Restaurants are scored: exact name match +12, partial name match +9, cuisine match +6, description partial match +2. ❖ Items are scored: exact name match +12, partial name match +8, tag match +5, category match +3. ❖ Ties are broken by stable UUID ordering. |
| _(5)_ | _BR-2.6_ | **Response Rules:** ❖ `total.restaurants` and `total.items` reflect the full match count before pagination is applied. ❖ If no results match the query, system returns HTTP 200 with empty arrays and zero totals — never HTTP 404. |

#### Message Rules

| Message Code | Message Content | Button |
|---|---|---|
| MSG-DISC-01 | lat and lon must both be provided together for geo search. | OK |

```

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(3)_ | _BR-4.1_ | **Validate Rules:** ❖ `quantity` must be in [1, 99]. `unitPrice` must be > 0. `menuItemId` and `restaurantId` must be valid UUIDs. `itemName` must be non-empty. ❖ Invalid input returns HTTP 400 with a field-level error message. |
| _(3)_, _(9)_ | _BR-4.2_ | **Item Availability Rules:** ❖ The item must exist in the Ordering ACL snapshot. If no snapshot is found, system returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-01`. ❖ Item `status` must be `'available'`. If not, system returns HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-CART-02`. |
| _(3)_, _(9)_ | _BR-4.3_ | **Modifier Validation Rules:** ❖ Each `(groupId, optionId)` pair must exist on the snapshot; the option must be available; per-group selection count must satisfy `minSelections ≤ count ≤ maxSelections`. ● Modifier group not found → HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-03`. ● Modifier option not found → HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-04`. ● Option unavailable → HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-05`. ● Below minimum selections → HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-06`. ● Exceeds maximum selections → HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-07`. |
| _(4)_, _(8)_ | _BR-4.4_ | **Single-Restaurant Cart Rules:** ❖ A customer's cart may only contain items from one restaurant at a time. If the cart already contains items from a different restaurant, system returns HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-CART-08`. ❖ If the ACL snapshot's `restaurantId` mismatches the request `restaurantId`, system returns HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-CART-09`. |
| _(5)_, _(7)_ | _BR-4.5_ | **Merge and Quantity Rules:** ❖ Line item identity is defined by `(menuItemId, modifierFingerprint)`. Adding the same item with identical modifier selections increments the existing line's quantity rather than creating a duplicate. ❖ The per-line quantity ceiling is 99. If adding would exceed this, system returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-10`. |
| _(5)–(6)_ | _BR-4.6_ | **Cart Persistence Rules:** ❖ Cart data is stored in Redis under the key `cart:<customerId>`. ❖ Every successful cart mutation resets the Redis TTL to 7 days. |

#### Message Rules

| Message Code | Message Content | Button |
|---|---|---|
| MSG-CART-01 | Menu item {menuItemId} has no local snapshot. Cannot validate modifier options. Please try again or contact support. | OK |
| MSG-CART-02 | Menu item '{itemName}' is currently not available (status: {status}). | OK |
| MSG-CART-03 | Modifier group {groupId} does not exist on this menu item. | OK |
| MSG-CART-04 | Modifier option {optionId} does not exist in group '{groupName}'. | OK |
| MSG-CART-05 | Modifier option '{optionName}' in group '{groupName}' is currently unavailable. | OK |
| MSG-CART-06 | Modifier group '{groupName}' requires at least {minSelections} selection(s), got {count}. | OK |
| MSG-CART-07 | Modifier group '{groupName}' allows at most {maxSelections} selection(s). | OK |
| MSG-CART-08 | Cart already contains items from restaurant '{restaurantName}'. Clear your cart before adding items from a different restaurant. | OK |
| MSG-CART-09 | Menu item {menuItemId} does not belong to restaurant {restaurantId}. | OK |
| MSG-CART-10 | Total quantity for item '{itemName}' would exceed the maximum of 99. | OK |

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(3)_ | _BR-5.1_ | **Cart Access Rules:** ❖ Cart is strictly scoped to the authenticated customer (`customerId = session.user.id`). ❖ If no cart exists for the customer, system returns HTTP 200 with `null`. |
| _(4)–(5)_, _(6)_ | _BR-5.2_ | **Update Quantity Rules:** ❖ `quantity` must be in [0, 99]. ❖ Setting `quantity = 0` is equivalent to removing the line item (same behavior as the Remove Item operation). ❖ If the `cartItemId` is not found in the customer's cart, system returns HTTP 404 referencing `MSG-CART-11`. |
| _(7)–(8)_, _(9)_ | _BR-5.3_ | **Update Modifiers Rules:** ❖ The modifier set is replaced wholesale. Modifier validation reuses the rules in BR-4.3 (`MSG-CART-03` … `MSG-CART-07`). ❖ If the new modifier selection produces a fingerprint that collides with an existing line, the two lines are merged subject to the 99-unit per-line ceiling. ❖ Overflow on merge returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-CART-10`. |
| _(10)_, _(11)_ | _BR-5.4_ | **Remove Item Rules:** ❖ If the `cartItemId` is not found in the customer's cart, system returns HTTP 404 referencing `MSG-CART-11`. |
| _(12)_ | _BR-5.5_ | **Clear Cart Rules:** ❖ Clear Cart is idempotent. Clearing an already-empty cart returns HTTP 204 without error. |
| _(5)_, _(10)_, _(12)–(13)_ | _BR-5.6_ | **Cart Empty State Rules:** ❖ When the last item is removed (by Update Qty to 0, Remove Item, or Clear Cart), the Redis key is deleted. Subsequent GET requests return `null`. Deletion operations return HTTP 204 No Content. |
| _(5)_, _(8)_, _(10)_, _(12)_ | _BR-5.7_ | **TTL Reset Rules:** ❖ Every successful cart mutation resets the Redis TTL to 7 days. ❖ Read-only GET (View Cart) does not reset the TTL. |

#### Message Rules

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(2)_, _(18)_ | _BR-8.1_ | **Validate Rules:** ❖ `paymentMethod` must be one of `{'cod', 'vnpay'}`. ❖ `deliveryAddress` must satisfy address validation rules (BR-6.1). ❖ `note` must be ≤ 500 characters. ❖ `X-Idempotency-Key` (if present) must be a UUID string of 8–64 hexadecimal characters with optional hyphens. ❖ Invalid input returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-ORD-01` (general validation) or `MSG-ORD-02` (idempotency key format). |
| _(3)_, _(17)_ | _BR-8.2_ | **Idempotency Rules:** ❖ If an `X-Idempotency-Key` is present and a cached `orderId` already exists for that key, system returns the existing order response without re-processing. ❖ The idempotency record is written after successful order persistence so that partial failures do not cache a stale state. |
| _(4)_, _(16)_ | _BR-8.3_ | **Concurrency Lock Rules:** ❖ System acquires a Redis `SET NX` lock at `cart:<customerId>:lock` with a 30-second TTL before processing. ❖ If the lock is already held, system returns HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-ORD-03`. ❖ The lock is released in a `finally` block to guarantee release even on exception. |
| _(5)_, _(15)_ | _BR-8.4_ | **Cart Validate Rules:** ❖ Cart must be non-empty. If empty, system returns HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-ORD-04`. ❖ The restaurant's Ordering ACL snapshot must exist. If missing, system returns HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-05`. ❖ Restaurant must have `isApproved = true`. If not, HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-06`. ❖ Restaurant must have `isOpen = true`. If not, HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-07`. |
| _(5)_, _(15)_ | _BR-8.5_ | **Item and Modifier Validation Rules:** ❖ Each cart item's Ordering ACL snapshot must exist. Delisted item → HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-08`. ❖ Item's `restaurantId` in snapshot must match cart's restaurant. Mismatch → HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-09`. ❖ Item `status` must be `'available'`. If `'out_of_stock'` or `'unavailable'` → HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-10`. ❖ Modifier groups, options, availability flags, and min/max constraints are re-validated against the current ACL snapshot at checkout time. |
| _(6)_, _(14)_ | _BR-8.6_ | **Delivery Pricing Rules:** ❖ Haversine distance is computed against the restaurant's delivery zone snapshots. The innermost eligible zone is selected (per BR-7.6). ❖ If the delivery address falls outside all zones → HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-11`. ❖ `shippingFee` is computed per BR-7.7. ❖ If coordinates or zone snapshots are unavailable, `shippingFee = 0` and a warning is logged (graceful degradation). |
| _(7)_ | _BR-8.7_ | **Promotion Reservation Rules:** ❖ Promotion reservation is non-blocking. If reservation fails or returns `discountAmount = 0`, checkout continues without a discount. ❖ Promotion usage is confirmed after successful order persistence. Failures in confirmation are reconciled by a scheduled task (Phase 3). |
| _(8)_, _(13)_ | _BR-8.8_ | **Server-Authoritative Pricing Rules:** ❖ Order line `unitPrice` and modifier prices are taken from ACL snapshots at checkout time, not from the values stored at add-to-cart time. ❖ `itemsTotal` must be > 0. If ≤ 0 → HTTP 422 referencing `MSG-ORD-12`. ❖ `totalAmount = max(0, itemsTotal + shippingFee − discountAmount)`. |
| _(8)_, _(13)_ | _BR-8.9_ | **Atomic Persistence Rules:** ❖ The `orders`, `order_items`, and initial `order_status_logs` row are inserted in a single database transaction. ❖ A `UNIQUE` constraint on `orders.cartId` prevents two orders from the same cart. ❖ Duplicate constraint violation → HTTP 409 referencing `MSG-ORD-13`. ❖ Generic database failure → HTTP 500 referencing `MSG-ORD-14`. |
| _(8)_ | _BR-8.10_ | **Initial Order State Rules:** ❖ New order `status = 'pending'`. ❖ `expiresAt = now + RESTAURANT_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 600 s). Orders not acknowledged by the restaurant within this window are auto-cancelled (Phase 2). |
| _(9)–(10)_ | _BR-8.11_ | **Payment Initiation Rules:** ❖ For `paymentMethod = 'vnpay'`: a `payment_transactions` row is created with `status = 'pending'`, and a VNPay redirect URL is generated and included in the response. ❖ For `paymentMethod = 'cod'`: no payment transaction is created at checkout; payment is collected at delivery. ❖ VNPay URL generation failure is logged but non-blocking; payment timeout reconciliation is handled by UC-9 (BR-9.7). |
| _(11)–(12)_ | _BR-8.12_ | **Post-Persistence Rules:** ❖ `OrderPlacedEvent` is published exactly once after successful persistence. ❖ Cart deletion (`cart:<customerId>`) is best-effort; failure does not invalidate the order. ❖ Successful response: HTTP 201 referencing `MSG-ORD-15` with payload `{ orderId, status: 'pending', totalAmount, shippingFee, discountAmount, paymentUrl?, estimatedDeliveryMinutes? }`. |

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(5)_, _(15)_ | _BR-9.1_ | **Signature Verification Rules:** ❖ The IPN signature is verified using HMAC-SHA512 over the sorted VNPay query parameters with the merchant secret key, using a constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. ❖ Signature verification is the mandatory first step before any database access. ❖ Invalid signature → system returns `MSG-PAY-01` (RspCode 97). |
| _(6)_, _(14)_ | _BR-9.2_ | **Transaction Lookup Rules:** ❖ `vnp_TxnRef` is used to resolve the `payment_transactions` record. ❖ If not found → system returns `MSG-PAY-02` (RspCode 01). |
| _(7)_, _(13)_ | _BR-9.3_ | **Idempotency Rules:** ❖ If the transaction is already in a terminal state (`'completed'`, `'failed'`, `'refund_pending'`, `'refunded'`), system acknowledges with `MSG-PAY-06` (RspCode 00) without making any further state change. |
| _(8)_, _(12)_ | _BR-9.4_ | **Amount Integrity Rules:** ❖ `vnp_Amount` divided by 100 must exactly match `payment_transactions.amount`. ❖ Any mismatch marks the transaction `'failed'` and returns `MSG-PAY-03` (RspCode 04). |
| _(10)_ | _BR-9.5_ | **Payment Success Rules:** ❖ On success: `payment_transactions.status = 'completed'`, and `paidAt`, `providerTxnId`, `rawIpnPayload` are recorded. ❖ `PaymentConfirmedEvent` is published. ❖ Order lifecycle listener transitions the order from `'pending'` to `'paid'`. ❖ System returns `MSG-PAY-04` (RspCode 00) to stop VNPay retry attempts. ❖ Concurrent IPN deliveries are resolved by optimistic locking on the `version` field. A concurrency conflict returns `MSG-PAY-07` (RspCode 99), prompting VNPay to retry. |
| _(11)_ | _BR-9.6_ | **Payment Failure Rules:** ❖ On VNPay failure response: `payment_transactions.status = 'failed'`, `vnpResponseCode`, and `rawIpnPayload` are recorded. ❖ `PaymentFailedEvent` is published. ❖ Order lifecycle listener transitions the order from `'pending'` to `'cancelled'`. ❖ System returns `MSG-PAY-05` (RspCode 00) to stop VNPay retry attempts. |
| _(16)–(17)_ | _BR-9.7_ | **Payment Timeout Rules:** ❖ `payment_transactions.expiresAt = now + PAYMENT_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. ❖ A scheduled `PaymentTimeoutTask` queries transactions with `status ∈ {'pending', 'awaiting_ipn'}` AND `expiresAt < now`. For each matching record, the task marks the transaction `'failed'`, publishes `PaymentFailedEvent`, and triggers order cancellation. |
| _—_ | _BR-9.8_ | **Return URL Rules:** ❖ The browser return URL (`/payments/vnpay/return`) is read-only. It verifies the signature and reads transaction status for UI feedback only. ❖ The return URL must never mutate database state. Authoritative payment outcome is determined exclusively by the IPN endpoint. |

| **Description** | This use case describes how a customer views their past orders, retrieves a detailed view of a specific order (including the status audit log), and initiates a reorder. |
| **Actor**       | Customer (authenticated, role `'user'`)                                                  |
| **Trigger**     | ❖ Customer navigates to the "Orders" or "Order History" screen. ❖ Customer selects a past order for detail. ❖ Customer taps "Reorder" on a past order. |
| **Pre-condition** | ❖ Customer is authenticated. |
| **Post-condition** | ❖ List: system returns a paginated list of the customer's orders. ❖ Detail: system returns the full order with item list and status audit log. ❖ Reorder: system returns a cart-shaped payload ready for the customer to submit via UC-4. |

#### Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(3)_, _(6)_ | _BR-10.1_ | **Filter Validate Rules:** ❖ `status` (if supplied) must match a canonical order status enum value (`'pending'`, `'paid'`, `'confirmed'`, `'preparing'`, `'ready_for_pickup'`, `'picked_up'`, `'delivering'`, `'delivered'`, `'cancelled'`, `'refunded'`). ❖ When both `minDate` and `maxDate` are supplied, `minDate ≤ maxDate` must hold. ❖ `limit` must be in [1, 100]; `offset` must be ≥ 0. ❖ Invalid filter values return HTTP 400 referencing `MSG-HIST-02`. |
| _(4)–(5)_ | _BR-10.2_ | **Ownership Scoping Rules:** ❖ The query is hard-scoped by `customerId = session.user.id`. No `customerId` query parameter is accepted from the client. ❖ Results are ordered by `createdAt DESC`. ❖ `total` reflects the full match count before pagination. |
| _(4)_ | _BR-10.3_ | **List Summary Aggregation Rules:** ❖ Each order row in the list response includes `itemCount` (sum of `order_items.quantity` for that order) and `firstItemName` (the name of the line item with the lowest insertion order). |
| _(8)_, _(10)_ | _BR-10.4_ | **Order Access Rules:** ❖ System loads the order by ID. If the order does not exist, or it exists but belongs to a different customer, system returns HTTP 404 referencing `MSG-HIST-01`. ❖ A uniform 404 is returned in both cases to prevent ownership disclosure. |
| _(8)–(9)_ | _BR-10.5_ | **Detail Completeness Rules:** ❖ The detail response includes the complete `order_status_logs` array in chronological order. ❖ Each log entry includes: `fromStatus`, `toStatus`, `triggeredByRole`, optional `note`, and `createdAt`. |
| _(12)–(13)_ | _BR-10.6_ | **Reorder Rules:** ❖ No server-side cart mutation occurs during reorder. System returns a cart-shaped payload derived from the historical `order_items` data. ❖ The client uses this payload to call UC-4 (Add Item to Cart). ❖ Historical prices and item names in the reorder payload may not reflect the current catalog. UC-4 re-validates all items, modifiers, and prices against the current ACL snapshot at the point of submission. |

#### Message Rules

| Message Code | Message Content | Button |
|---|---|---|
| MSG-HIST-01 | Order {orderId} not found. | OK |
| MSG-HIST-02 | Invalid filter values. Status must be a canonical order state; date range must satisfy minDate ≤ maxDate; limit ∈ [1, 100]; offset ≥ 0. | OK |
