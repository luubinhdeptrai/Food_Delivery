### **1 Documentation Roadmap**

The Documentation Roadmap is the entry point for readers of this SAD. It explains the document control information, scope, organization, stakeholder mapping, viewpoint definitions, view documentation rules, relationship to companion architecture documents, and the update process.

Subsections of Section 1 follow the SAD template structure:

- Section 1.1 records revision management and configuration control information.
- Section 1.2 defines the purpose and scope of the SAD.
- Section 1.3 explains how the SAD is organized.
- Section 1.4 maps stakeholders to architecture viewpoints.
- Section 1.5 defines the viewpoints used by Section 3 views.
- Section 1.6 defines the standard view-packet format.
- Section 1.7 identifies relationship to other SADs and companion architecture artifacts.
- Section 1.8 defines the process for updating this SAD.

#### **1.1 Document Management and Configuration Control Information**

_Table 1: Document revision history_

| Revision Number | Revision Release Date | Purpose of Revision | Scope of Revision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2026-05-23 | Establish a template-compliant Software Architecture Document for the SoLi Food Delivery Platform. | Entire SAD organized according to SAD-Template.md; architecture content migrated from ASR, ADD, ADR, traceability matrices, requirements documents, deployment artifacts, and source evidence. |

#### **1.2 Purpose and Scope of the SAD**

This SAD specifies the software architecture for the SoLi Food Delivery Platform. It documents the structures of the system, the externally visible properties of architectural elements, and the relationships among those elements. It uses the SEI Views and Beyond style from SAD-Template.md.

The scope covers:

- Backend API: NestJS modular monolith under apps/api.
- Web dashboard: React/Vite dashboard under apps/web.
- Mobile application: Expo React Native application under apps/mobile.
- Persistent data: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM schemas grouped by bounded-context ownership.
- Runtime state: Redis / Valkey for cart, checkout locks, idempotency, presence, unread-count acceleration, and planned rate-limit buckets.
- External providers: VNPay, Cloudinary, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and SMTP email.
- Delivery process: GitHub Actions validation, Docker image publication, mobile artifact publication, and Render image-based deployment.

The SAD includes architectural information only: elements, relations, externally visible behavior, constraints, quality-attribute tactics, and traceability. Detailed endpoint contracts, screen layouts, and private code logic belong to downstream requirements, source code, and test artifacts.

Source authority rule: when a structure is present in repository source, this SAD uses the repository as the primary evidence. When a target architecture structure is required by the approved requirements, ASR, ADD, or ADR documents and a matching source unit is absent from the repository, this SAD keeps the structure as an architecture contract and traces it to those approved documents. Tables 10, 12, 14, and 22 make this distinction explicit without adding progress labels.

#### **1.3 How the SAD Is Organized**

This SAD is organized into the following template sections:

- **Section 1, Documentation Roadmap,** provides document control, purpose, stakeholder mapping, viewpoint definitions, view documentation rules, relationship to companion SADs, and update process.
- **Section 2, Architecture Background,** explains the problem background, goals, significant driving requirements, architectural approaches, analysis results, requirements coverage, background changes, and product-line reuse considerations.
- **Section 3, Views,** specifies the Logical, Implementation, Data, Runtime, Deployment, and Development / Process views. Each view conforms to a viewpoint defined in Section 1.5 and is documented with view packets as required by Section 1.6.
- **Section 4, Relations Among Views,** records consistency relations and mappings among views.
- **Section 5, Referenced Materials,** lists source documents and source artifacts cited by this SAD.
- **Section 6, Directory,** provides an index, glossary, and acronym list.
- **Section 7, Sample Figures & Tables,** is retained for template compliance and records the sample-section status for this project document.

Customers, restaurant partners, delivery personnel, administrators, development team members, and architecture reviewers use this viewpoint to understand which business responsibilities belong to each context and which cross-context relationships are allowed.

###### **1.5.1.3 Elements, Relations, Properties, and Constraints**

Elements are actors, bounded contexts, domain components, shared ports, and domain-event channels. Relations include actor access, context dependency, event publication/subscription, ACL projection, and port realization. Constraints include single ownership for each business rule and explicit dependency boundaries between contexts.

###### **1.5.1.4 Language(s) to Model/Represent Conforming Views**

PlantUML component notation and text element catalogs.

###### **1.5.1.5 Applicable Evaluation/Analysis Techniques and Consistency/Completeness Criteria**

Completeness criteria: every SRS domain and every AD-1 through AD-12 driver maps to one bounded context or cross-context relation; every ADR is visible through at least one logical element or relation; no context owns another context's business state.

###### **1.5.1.6 Viewpoint Source**

SAD-Template.md, ADD_FoodDelivery.md Logical View, ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-004, ADR-005, and the traceability matrices.

Developers, testers, release owners, operations owners, and architecture reviewers use this viewpoint to verify that release artifacts are validated and that source, schema, and runtime artifacts remain aligned.

###### **1.5.6.3 Elements, Relations, Properties, and Constraints**

Elements include repository source, CI workflow, validation workflow, Postgres/Redis CI services, lint/typecheck/audit/test/build steps, Docker publication workflow, mobile publication workflow, GHCR images, APK artifact, migration gate, and Render services. Relations include workflow dependency, artifact generation, publication, and release dependency.

###### **1.5.6.4 Language(s) to Model/Represent Conforming Views**

PlantUML component/activity style and process catalogs.

###### **1.5.6.5 Applicable Evaluation/Analysis Techniques and Consistency/Completeness Criteria**

Completeness criteria: each release artifact passes through validation and has a packaging or deployment destination; migration and environment configuration are visible in the process.

###### **1.5.6.6 Viewpoint Source**

GitHub workflows, CD_GUIDE.md, Dockerfiles, Drizzle schema flow, and ADR-008.

#### **1.6 How a View is Documented**

#### **1.7 Relationship to Other SADs**

This is the SAD for the SoLi Food Delivery Platform in this repository. It incorporates by reference the ASR, ADD, ADR, SRS, use-case, user-story, deployment, and source artifacts listed in Section 5. No separate SoLi SAD supersedes this document.

#### **1.8 Process for Updating this SAD**

Updates to this SAD follow this process:

1. Identify the changed requirement, driver, decision, view element, source artifact, or deployment artifact.
2. Update the owning source artifact first when the change belongs outside the SAD.
3. Update the affected viewpoint definition, view packet, relation table, referenced material, index, glossary, or acronym list.
4. Recheck traceability from User Story to UC to SRS to ASR to ADD to ADR to SAD.
5. Recheck figure order, table order, local links, diagram block balance, and banned progress wording.
6. Record the revision in Table 1.

### **2 Architecture Background**

#### **2.1 Problem Background**

##### **2.1.1 System Overview**

SoLi is a multi-role food delivery marketplace that connects customers, restaurant partners, delivery personnel, administrators, and external providers. The system supports account access, restaurant discovery, cart and checkout, COD and VNPay payment, menu and availability management, order lifecycle transitions, promotions, notifications, delivery completion, review/rating, and administrative governance.

The backend architecture is a modular monolith: one NestJS API deployable contains bounded contexts with explicit module ownership, local persistence boundaries, in-process EventBus integration, ACL snapshots, Redis runtime state, and ports/adapters for external or cross-context variation points.

##### **2.1.2 Goals and Context**

The business goals originate from the Vision and Scope document and BRD:

- BO-1: reduce average ordering time below five minutes.
- BO-2: increase restaurant partner daily order volume.
- BO-3: achieve a delivery success rate of 95 percent or higher.
- BO-4: process a high share of completed orders through digital payment.

The binding business rules are:

- BR-1: partner verification before operation.
- BR-2: single-restaurant cart constraint.
- BR-3: delivery radius constraint.
- BR-4: COD and VNPay payment methods with server-side payment confirmation.
- BR-5: commission calculation from completed order GMV.
- BR-6: one designated operating service area.
- BR-7: sequential order lifecycle integrity.
- BR-8: real-time restaurant and item availability control.
- BR-9: exclusion of B2B enterprise ordering and subscription meal plans.

#### **2.2 Solution Background**

##### **2.2.1 Architectural Approaches**

_Table 5: Architectural Approaches and ADR Use_

| ADR | Accepted approach | SAD location | Driver and QA trace |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Modular monolith architecture. | Logical, Implementation, Deployment, Development / Process views. | AD-1, AD-3, AD-4, QA-MA-01, QA-SC-01 |
| ADR-002 | Bounded-context separation. | Logical, Implementation, Data views. | AD-3, AD-5, AD-8, QA-CI-01 |
| ADR-003 | Database per BC ownership. | Data View and Relations Among Views. | AD-3, AD-5, AD-10, QA-MA-02 |
| ADR-004 | In-process EventBus communication. | Logical and Runtime views. | AD-3, AD-4, AD-12 |
| ADR-005 | ACL snapshot pattern. | Logical, Data, Runtime views. | AD-3, AD-7, QA-P-04, QA-CI-02 |
| ADR-006 | Redis runtime layer. | Data, Runtime, Deployment views. | AD-1, AD-4, AD-6, AD-11, QA-SC-02 |
| ADR-007 | Ports and adapters integration pattern. | Logical, Implementation, Runtime views. | AD-2, AD-9, AD-12, QA-FL-01, QA-I-01, QA-I-03 |
| ADR-008 | Drizzle type-safe persistence layer. | Implementation, Data, Development / Process views. | AD-1, AD-2, AD-5, AD-10, QA-MA-02, QA-T-01 |

The selected approach preserves domain boundaries while keeping the platform in one deployable. Cross-context coordination uses local domain events, explicit ports, and ACL snapshots. Durable state is grouped by bounded-context ownership in one PostgreSQL database. Volatile coordination state is externalized to Redis / Valkey so multiple API instances can share carts, locks, idempotency keys, presence, and planned rate-limit buckets.

##### **2.2.2 Analysis Results**

_Table 6: Analysis Results_

| Quality attribute | Realization tactics | Architecture elements | Trace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Performance | Paginated search, Redis cart operations, local ACL snapshots, Socket.IO push, efficient checkout command. | Catalog Search, Cart Redis Repository, ACL Snapshot Repositories, Notification Gateway, PlaceOrderHandler. | QA-P-01, QA-P-02, QA-P-03, QA-P-04 |

| Reusability | Configuration-with-history pattern, ports/adapters, shared validators, reusable provider abstractions. | Shared kernel, Promotion and Payment ports, Notification providers, governance configuration. | US-30, ADR-007 |

Architecture audit conclusions:

- Business drivers AD-1 through AD-12 are used by at least one view and one decision.
- Runtime scenarios are tied to SRS UCs and ADD quality scenarios.
- Deployment decisions trace to availability, scalability, security, interoperability, and supportability drivers.
- The flight-booking backlog and ADD example are treated as course/example inputs only; they do not introduce SoLi requirements.

##### **2.2.3 Requirements Coverage**

_Table 7: Requirements Coverage Summary_

| Trace layer | Source artifact | SAD usage |
|---|---|---|
| Vision | [../Food_Delivery_Vision_and_Scope.md](../Food_Delivery_Vision_and_Scope.md) | Business goals, market context, release scope, stakeholder concerns. |
| BRD | [../BRD.md](../BRD.md) | Business objectives, stakeholder profiles, system context, non-functional expectations. |
| Business Rules | [../Business_Rules.md](../Business_Rules.md) | Cart, payment, lifecycle, commission, partner approval, geography, availability constraints. |
| User Stories | [../User-Stories-and-Acceptance-Criteria.md](../User-Stories-and-Acceptance-Criteria.md) | Story-to-UC trace, acceptance criteria, QA references, orphan audit closure. |
| Use Cases | [../USE_CASE_SPECIFICATION.md](../USE_CASE_SPECIFICATION.md), [../SRS_FoodDelivery.md](../SRS_FoodDelivery.md), [../SRS_SequenceDiagrams.md](../SRS_SequenceDiagrams.md) | UC-DOM-01 through UC-DOM-12 and SRS UC-1 through UC-35. |
| ASR | [ASR_FoodDelivery.md](ASR_FoodDelivery.md), [../Utility-Tree-ASRs.md](../Utility-Tree-ASRs.md) | Architectural drivers AD-1 through AD-12 and QA scenario links. |
| ADD | [ADD_FoodDelivery.md](ADD_FoodDelivery.md) | Architecture views, quality-attribute scenario bodies, design constraints. |
| ADR | [ADR_FoodDelivery.md](ADR_FoodDelivery.md) | Accepted decisions ADR-001 through ADR-008. |
| Source and delivery artifacts | apps/api, apps/web, apps/mobile, GitHub workflows, Dockerfiles, CD guide | Module composition, schemas, repositories, handlers, providers, clients, packaging, deployment topology. |

Coverage rule: every architecture element in this SAD must trace to at least one source in Table 7. Repository evidence has priority where code exists. Approved documents in Table 7 are the authority for target architecture elements whose repository source unit is absent. The authoritative traceability matrices are maintained in [../User-Stories-and-Acceptance-Criteria.md](../User-Stories-and-Acceptance-Criteria.md). This SAD uses those matrices as the traceability contract.

##### **2.2.4 Summary of Background Changes Reflected in Current Version**

Revision 1.0 of this SAD normalizes the architecture documentation to the SAD-Template.md structure. The prior custom top-level organization is removed. Architecture content is migrated into the template locations: Section 2 for architecture background, ADR summary, analysis, and requirements coverage; Section 3 for view packets; Section 4 for view relations; Section 5 for references; Section 6 for directory; and Section 7 for template sample-section status.

#### **2.3 Product Line Reuse Considerations**

Reusable architectural assets in this product line are:

- Modular-monolith bounded-context structure.
- Ports and adapters for payment, promotion, image, push, and email providers.
- Drizzle schema ownership and migration pattern.
- Redis runtime-state pattern for high-churn coordination state.
- Event envelope and in-process EventBus integration pattern.
- Configuration-with-history governance pattern for operational settings.
- CI/CD workflow pattern for validation, Docker image publication, mobile artifact publication, and image-backed deployment.

The course/example artifacts [ADD.md](ADD.md), [ASR - Architectual Significant Requirements.md](ASR%20-%20Architectual%20Significant%20Requirements.md), and [Product backlog - Flight Booking System.md](Product%20backlog%20-%20Flight%20Booking%20System.md) were reviewed for format and QA vocabulary. They are not SoLi requirements sources and do not add architecture elements to this SAD.

### **3 Views**

This section contains the views of the software architecture. Each view conforms to a viewpoint defined in Section 1.5 and uses the view-packet format defined in Section 1.6.

_Table 8: Views Presented in this SAD_

| Name of view | Viewpoint that defines this view | Types of elements and relations shown | Is this a module view? | Is this a component-and-connector view? | Is this an allocation view? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logical View | Logical | Actors, bounded contexts, domain components, events, ports, dependencies. | Yes | Limited | No |
| Implementation View | Implementation | Source units, modules, schemas, clients, providers, CI/CD artifacts. | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Data View | Data | Table groups, Redis keys, provider-owned records, ownership and reference relations. | Limited | No | Yes |
| Runtime View | Runtime | Actors, clients, handlers, services, ports, EventBus, storage, providers, dynamic calls. | No | Yes | No |
| Deployment View | Deployment | Nodes, runtime instances, shared services, external providers, release infrastructure. | No | Yes | Yes |
| Development / Process View | Development / Process | Repository, validation workflows, artifacts, image publication, release steps. | Limited | No | Yes |

#### **3.1 Logical View**

##### **3.1.1 View Description**

The Logical View partitions SoLi by business capability. It shows actors, bounded contexts, domain components, outbound ports, domain events, and cross-context contracts. It omits concrete repositories, controllers, databases, and provider runtime details.

##### **3.1.2 View Packet Overview**

_Table 9: Logical View Packet Overview_

| View packet | Coverage | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1.5.1 Logical Architecture Packet | Bounded contexts, actors, domain events, ports, logical dependencies. | One logical packet covers the domain decomposition without mixing runtime or source-unit details. |

##### **3.1.3 Architecture Background**

The logical architecture follows ADR-001 and ADR-002: one backend deployable, separated by bounded contexts. Restaurant search remains inside Restaurant Catalog; delivery-zone ownership remains in Catalog; delivery progress is represented through Ordering lifecycle and shipper transitions; Notification is separate from Ordering because user communication and delivery state are different responsibilities. Review & Rating and Admin/Governance are first-class architecture contracts required by SRS, BRD, ADD, ADR-002, and the trace matrices; their source authority is the approved architecture documentation when a repository module is absent.

##### **3.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Logical variability is provided through bounded-context contracts, domain events, shared ports, provider adapters, and configuration-backed policy values. These mechanisms allow provider replacement, promotion-rule evolution, order-transition extension, and reporting-policy evolution while preserving the same bounded-context ownership model.

**3.1.5.1.2.1 Elements**

Elements are the actors, bounded contexts, domain components, event hub, and shared ports shown in Figure 1.

**3.1.5.1.2.2 Relations**

Allowed relations are actor access, context dependency, event publication/subscription, ACL projection, and port realization.

**3.1.5.1.2.3 Interfaces**

Interfaces visible across context boundaries are domain events, PAYMENT_INITIATION_PORT, PROMOTION_APPLICATION_PORT, REST/Socket.IO client contracts, and ACL snapshot projections.

**3.1.5.1.2.4 Behavior**

Logical behavior is captured by the runtime packets in Section 3.4. The Logical View owns responsibility allocation rather than temporal flow.

**3.1.5.1.2.5 Constraints**

Each business invariant has one owner. Cross-context reads use stable contracts, ports, events, or snapshots. Payment and promotion provider details stay outside Ordering.

**3.1.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 1 is also the context diagram for the Logical View. The distinguished scope is the NestJS API Boundary rectangle. External actors are Customer, Restaurant Owner, Shipper, and Admin.

**3.1.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Variability is expressed through ports, provider adapters, event subscribers, and configuration values.

**3.1.5.1.5 Architecture Background**

This packet realizes ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-004, ADR-005, and ADR-007.

**3.1.5.1.6 Related View Packets**

Related packets: 3.2.5.1 maps these logical contexts to source units; 3.3.5.1 maps them to data ownership; 3.4.5.1 through 3.4.5.4 show runtime behavior.

#### **3.2 Implementation View**

##### **3.2.1 View Description**

The Implementation View maps the logical architecture onto repository structure, NestJS modules, Drizzle schemas, Redis usage, provider adapters, web/mobile clients, and CI/CD artifacts.

##### **3.2.2 View Packet Overview**

_Table 11: Implementation View Packet Overview_

| View packet | Coverage | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 3.2.5.1 Source and Artifact Packet | apps/api modules, apps/web, apps/mobile, infrastructure, storage, providers, workflows, Docker artifacts. | One packet keeps source allocation and delivery artifacts visible without duplicating runtime sequences. |

##### **3.2.3 Architecture Background**

The repository is organized as a monorepo with apps/api, apps/web, and apps/mobile. The backend uses NestJS modules, Better Auth, Drizzle, Redis, CQRS/EventBus, provider adapters, and shared contracts. The web and mobile clients consume API and realtime contracts from the backend. Delivery artifacts are produced through GitHub workflows and Dockerfiles.

##### **3.2.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Implementation variability is provided through NestJS dependency injection, shared ports, provider abstractions, environment schema validation, workflow inputs, Docker build matrix entries, and client feature modules.

Reuse note: Figure 2 is reused from [ADD_FoodDelivery.md](ADD_FoodDelivery.md) Section 3.2 Implementation View. Client applications, CI/CD workflows, Dockerfiles, and deployment artifacts remain allocated in the element catalog, Deployment View, and Development / Process View so the ADD implementation diagram is not redrawn.

**3.2.5.1.2.1 Elements**

Elements in Figure 2 are backend source units, provider adapters, storage interfaces, shared-kernel contracts, and infrastructure dependencies. Client packages, workflow files, and packaging artifacts are cataloged here and allocated in Sections 3.5 and 3.6.

**3.2.5.1.2.2 Relations**

Relations include module composition, source dependency, provider adapter binding, schema export, workflow sequence, and artifact publication.

**3.2.5.1.2.3 Interfaces**

Visible implementation interfaces are REST, Socket.IO, DB_CONNECTION, RedisService, shared events, shared ports, and provider APIs. GitHub workflow contracts, Docker image tags, and mobile artifact outputs are described by the Development / Process View.

**3.2.5.1.2.4 Behavior**

Behavioral flows are described in the Runtime View. The Implementation View identifies the source units that participate in those flows.

**3.2.5.1.2.5 Constraints**

Business modules must preserve bounded-context ownership. Provider-specific behavior must remain behind adapters. Workflow artifacts must preserve validation before publication.

**3.2.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 2 is the context diagram for this packet. The distinguished scope is `apps/api`; client and delivery artifact boundaries are related allocation evidence captured in Sections 3.5 and 3.6.

**3.2.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

NestJS DI tokens, environment configuration, provider interfaces, workflow matrices, and client feature modules provide variability.

**3.2.5.1.5 Architecture Background**

This packet realizes ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-006, ADR-007, and ADR-008.

**3.2.5.1.6 Related View Packets**

Related packets: 3.1.5.1 for logical ownership, 3.3.5.1 for data ownership, 3.6.5.1 for workflow and release process.

#### **3.3 Data View**

##### **3.3.1 View Description**

The Data View shows PostgreSQL as the single physical database with logical table groups owned by bounded contexts. It also shows Redis / Valkey runtime state and external provider data ownership. Local foreign-key-style relations remain inside ownership boundaries; cross-context references are logical UUIDs or event-projected snapshots. Drizzle schema files are the authority for repository-present data groups; approved requirements, ASR, ADD, and ADR documents are the authority for target data contracts whose module-owned schema is absent.

##### **3.3.2 View Packet Overview**

_Table 13: Data View Packet Overview_

| View packet | Coverage | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 3.3.5.1 Data Ownership Packet | PostgreSQL table groups, Redis key groups, provider-owned data, ownership and reference relations. | One data packet keeps durable, volatile, and external data authority in one ownership map. |

##### **3.3.3 Architecture Background**

The Data View realizes ADR-003 and ADR-008 for PostgreSQL and Drizzle ownership, ADR-005 for ACL snapshots, and ADR-006 for Redis runtime state. It supports AD-1, AD-2, AD-3, AD-5, AD-6, AD-7, AD-10, AD-11, and AD-12.

##### **3.3.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Data variability is provided through schema migrations, context-owned table groups, Redis TTLs, provider references, version fields, and snapshot refresh through events.

##### **3.3.5 View Packets**

**3.3.5.1.1 Primary Presentation**

_Figure 3: Data View - PostgreSQL ownership, Redis state, and external data owners_

Reuse note: Figure 3 is reused from [ADD_FoodDelivery.md](ADD_FoodDelivery.md) Section 3.4 Data View. The implemented Image schema remains metadata-only (`publicId`, `secureUrl`, `width`, `height`, `createdAt`); Review/Rating, Admin/Governance, and rate-limit buckets stay explicitly marked as target/planned contracts.

**3.3.5.1.2 Element Catalog**

_Table 14: Data Ownership Catalog_

| Data group | Owner | Storage | Source authority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Users, sessions, accounts, verification | Auth BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Internal Auth relations stay inside one ownership boundary. |
| Restaurants, zones, menu, modifiers | Restaurant Catalog BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Catalog emits events for downstream ACL snapshots. |
| Image metadata | Image BC | PostgreSQL plus Cloudinary | Drizzle schema plus provider contract. | Database stores metadata; image bytes are external assets. |
| Cart | Ordering BC | Redis | Redis repository and ADR-006. | Volatile per-customer cart state. |
| Orders, items, status logs, app settings | Ordering BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Lifecycle audit and checkout transaction boundary. |
| Ordering ACL snapshots | Ordering BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema plus ADR-005. | Local read models for checkout decisions. |
| Payment transactions | Payment BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Logical references to order and customer IDs. |
| Promotions, coupons, usage | Promotion BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Reservation/confirmation/rollback supports compensation. |
| Notifications, preferences, tokens, delivery logs | Notification BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema. | Durable inbox and channel delivery evidence. |
| Notification ACL snapshots | Notification BC | PostgreSQL | Drizzle schema plus ADR-005. | Local routing data for restaurant-related notifications. |
| Review and rating | Review & Rating BC | PostgreSQL | SRS, BRD, ADD, and ADR target data contract. | Delivered-order eligibility and aggregate rating summaries. |
| Governance audit and partner application decisions | Admin / Governance BC | PostgreSQL | SRS, BRD, ADD, ASR, and ADR target data contract; repository evidence covers restaurant approval, role state, order status logs, payment transactions, and notification delivery logs. | Admin decisions and privileged action history. |
| Idempotency, locks, presence, planned rate-limit buckets | Owning BC per use case | Redis / Valkey | Redis repository, ASR, ADD, and deployment target. | Shared runtime state across API instances; rate limiting is planned. |
| Gateway, asset, push, and email authority | External providers | Provider-owned | Provider contracts and adapters. | Referenced by provider IDs, URLs, tokens, and delivery metadata. |

**3.3.5.1.2.1 Elements**

Elements are the PostgreSQL table groups, Redis key groups, and external provider records shown in Figure 3.

**3.3.5.1.2.2 Relations**

Relations are owner relation, local data relation, logical UUID reference, event-projected snapshot, Redis key scope, and provider reference.

**3.3.5.1.2.3 Interfaces**

Interfaces are Drizzle schemas/repositories, DB_CONNECTION, RedisService, provider identifiers, and event projectors.

**3.3.5.1.2.4 Behavior**

Data behavior includes ACID transactions for order creation, optimistic locking for lifecycle/payment state, TTL expiry for volatile Redis keys, and idempotent snapshot upserts.

**3.3.5.1.2.5 Constraints**

Only owning contexts write their table groups. Cross-context reads use ports, events, repositories, or snapshots. External provider payloads remain at the adapter boundary.

**3.3.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 3 is the context diagram for data ownership. The distinguished scope is PostgreSQL plus Redis state controlled by the SoLi backend; external providers are outside the data ownership boundary.

**3.3.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Schema migrations, event replay, TTL configuration, provider identifiers, and reporting replicas are the variability mechanisms for this packet.

**3.3.5.1.5 Architecture Background**

This packet realizes ADR-003, ADR-005, ADR-006, and ADR-008.

**3.3.5.1.6 Related View Packets**

Related packets: 3.1.5.1 for ownership semantics, 3.2.5.1 for source schema ownership, 3.4.5.1 and 3.4.5.2 for transaction and projection behavior.

#### **3.4 Runtime View**

##### **3.4.1 View Description**

The Runtime View shows dynamic interactions for architecturally significant scenarios: order placement, EventBus + ACL synchronization, payment compensation, and delivery-to-review. It contains sequence diagrams only for flows that are driven by SRS UCs and ASR/ADD quality scenarios.

##### **3.4.2 View Packet Overview**

_Table 15: Runtime View Packet Overview_

| View packet | Runtime scenario | UC and driver coverage |
|---|---|---|
| 3.4.5.1 Order Placement Runtime Packet | Checkout from cart to order response. | UC-8, UC-9, UC-23, UC-24, AD-1, AD-2, AD-6, AD-7, AD-12 |
| 3.4.5.2 Event and ACL Synchronization Runtime Packet | Catalog change to Ordering/Notification snapshots. | UC-7, UC-11, UC-12, UC-13, UC-26, AD-3, AD-7, AD-9 |
| 3.4.5.3 Payment Compensation Runtime Packet | VNPay failure/timeout to cancellation, refund, promotion rollback, notification. | UC-9, UC-21, UC-25, UC-32, AD-2, AD-12 |
| 3.4.5.4 Delivery to Review Runtime Packet | Delivery confirmation to customer notification and review eligibility. | UC-19, UC-20, UC-22, AD-4, AD-5, AD-10 |

##### **3.4.3 Architecture Background**

The Runtime View realizes ADD runtime scenarios and SRS sequence flows while preserving the modular-monolith decisions from ADR-001, ADR-004, ADR-006, ADR-007, and ADR-008. Runtime packets focus on stimulus-response behavior rather than source-code decomposition.

Reuse note: Figures 4 through 7 are new SAD runtime packets because no single ADD runtime view corresponds to these architecture-level scenarios. Their participant style, message numbering, activation bars, and boundary/control/database notation are derived from [../SRS_SequenceDiagrams.md](../SRS_SequenceDiagrams.md), especially SD-8, SD-9, SD-11 through SD-13, SD-19 through SD-22, SD-25, SD-26, and SD-32.

##### **3.4.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Runtime variability is provided by payment method selection, provider adapters, event handlers, compensation handlers, Redis TTLs, state-machine transitions, and notification channel preferences.

##### **3.4.5 View Packets**

###### **3.4.5.1 Order Placement Runtime Packet**

**3.4.5.1.2 Element Catalog**

Elements: Customer, Checkout Page / Mobile App, Cart Service, PlaceOrderHandler, Redis, Ordering / ACL repositories, Promotion Application Port, Promotion Service, Payment Initiation Port, Payment Service, EventBus, Notification Service.

Relations: synchronous command call, Redis cart/lock/idempotency access, repository transaction, port call, event publication, event handling, notification persistence.

Interfaces: PlaceOrderCommand, PAYMENT_INITIATION_PORT, PROMOTION_APPLICATION_PORT, OrderPlacedEvent, Redis key contracts, Drizzle repositories.

Behavior: checkout validates cart, restaurant, items, delivery zone, promotion, payment method, and idempotency before order response.

Constraints: order response must remain duplicate-safe under retry; promotion confirmation and rollback must remain explicit; events are published after durable state changes.

**3.4.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 4 provides the packet context. The distinguished scope is the checkout runtime flow from customer stimulus to persisted order response.

**3.4.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Payment method, promotion rule set, idempotency TTL, cart lock TTL, and notification channels are variable within this packet.

Elements: Restaurant Partner / Admin, Catalog Management UI, Catalog Controller, Catalog Service, Catalog Repository, EventBus, Ordering ACL Projector, Ordering Snapshot Repository, Notification ACL Projector, Notification Snapshot Repository.

Relations: catalog mutation, event publication, projector subscription, idempotent snapshot upsert, local snapshot read readiness.

Interfaces: Catalog update commands, RestaurantUpdatedEvent, MenuItemUpdatedEvent, delivery-zone update event, snapshot repository contracts.

Behavior: Catalog remains source of truth; Ordering and Notification receive local snapshots through in-process event handlers.

Constraints: Ordering and Notification must not depend on Catalog table internals for checkout or notification routing decisions.

**3.4.5.2.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 5 provides the packet context. The distinguished scope is catalog-change propagation into local ACL snapshots.

Interfaces: PAYMENT_INITIATION_PORT, PROMOTION_APPLICATION_PORT, PaymentFailedEvent, OrderCancelledAfterPaymentEvent, TransitionOrderCommand, VNPay signed protocol.

Behavior: payment failure or timeout results in durable payment state, order cancellation, promotion rollback, and notification side effects. A paid VNPay cancellation publishes a refund-side-effect event; the current source records refund state while the real VNPay refund API remains partial/stubbed.

Constraints: compensation is idempotent; Ordering does not call VNPay directly; Payment owns provider financial state.

Relations: lifecycle transition, optimistic state update, event publication, customer notification, target review eligibility check, target review persistence, target rating projection update.

Interfaces: TransitionOrderCommand, OrderStatusChangedEvent, notification channel contracts, review submission contract, rating-summary contract.

Behavior: delivery completion publishes customer notification in the implemented Ordering/Notification path. The Review & Rating portion remains the UC-22 target contract and is shown as an optional target flow.

Constraints: review eligibility depends on delivered-order ownership when the target Review BC is implemented; lifecycle transitions remain governed by the single transition map.

**3.4.5.4.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 7 provides the packet context. The distinguished scope is delivery completion, implemented notification, and the approved target review/rating extension.

**3.5.5.1.2 Element Catalog**

_Table 18: Deployment Assumptions_

| Assumption | Architecture rule | Trace |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum runtime availability | The deployment view uses at least two API instances behind a load balancer as a target topology. | QA-A-01, QA-A-02, QA-SC-01 |
| Scaling unit | API scaling means adding complete modular-monolith instances, not splitting individual BCs into services. | ADR-001, ADR-004 |
| Shared volatile state | Redis / Valkey is shared by all API instances for carts, locks, idempotency, presence, and quotas. | ADR-006 |
| Durable state | PostgreSQL remains the durable source of truth with backup and replica options for operational reporting. | ADR-003, ADR-008 |
| Realtime traffic | Multi-instance WebSocket traffic requires sticky sessions or a Socket.IO Redis adapter before multi-instance realtime correctness can be claimed. | AD-4, QA-A-02 |
| External providers | VNPay, Cloudinary, FCM, and SMTP are called only through provider adapters. | ADR-007 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions validates, builds, packages, and publishes images/artifacts; Render deploy hooks are documented as the target image-backed deployment step. | Development / Process View |

**3.5.5.1.2.1 Elements**

Elements are client devices, GitHub, GitHub Actions, GHCR, Render deploy hooks, HTTPS edge, load balancer, web service, API autoscaling group, API Instance 1, API Instance 2, API Instance N, PostgreSQL, Redis / Valkey, monitoring, rate limiting, and providers.

**3.5.5.1.2.2 Relations**

Relations include HTTPS, REST, realtime channel, image pull, database connection, Redis connection, provider API call, monitoring flow, and workflow artifact publication.

**3.5.5.1.2.3 Interfaces**

Interfaces are HTTPS endpoints, Socket.IO namespace, provider APIs, Docker image tags, GHCR registry contract, Render deploy hooks, PostgreSQL connection, Redis connection, and environment variables.

**3.5.5.1.2.4 Behavior**

The load balancer routes traffic to API instances. API instances share Redis and PostgreSQL. Provider calls leave through adapters. CI/CD builds artifacts and deploys by immutable image reference.

**3.5.5.1.2.5 Constraints**

API instances must be stateless at the process level. Redis and PostgreSQL must be reachable from every API instance. Provider secrets must come from environment configuration.

**3.5.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 8 is the context diagram for deployment. The distinguished scope is the Render / Production Runtime node.

**3.5.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

API instance count, image tags, autoscaling thresholds, Redis adapter selection, provider credentials, and PostgreSQL backup/replica settings are variable.

**3.5.5.1.5 Architecture Background**

This packet realizes ADR-001, ADR-003, ADR-006, ADR-007, ADR-008, AD-4, AD-11, and the CD guide.

**3.5.5.1.6 Related View Packets**

Related packets: 3.2.5.1 for artifacts, 3.3.5.1 for data services, 3.6.5.1 for release process.

#### **3.6 Development / Process View**

##### **3.6.1 View Description**

The Development / Process View shows how source changes move from developer commit to validated artifact and runtime release. It uses the repository workflows and deployment guide as process evidence.

##### **3.6.2 View Packet Overview**

_Table 19: Development / Process View Packet Overview_

| View packet | Coverage | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 3.6.5.1 Validation and Release Packet | Source change, CI, validation workflow, test services, Docker images, GHCR, APK artifact, migration gate, Render services. | One process packet captures release flow without duplicating deployment node allocation. |

##### **3.6.3 Architecture Background**

The process view supports ADR-008 by tying schema shape to validation and release, supports ADR-001 by validating one monorepo, and supports quality scenarios for testability, supportability, maintainability, and security.

##### **3.6.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Process variability is provided through workflow triggers, reusable setup action, service containers, pnpm/turbo commands, Docker build matrix, mobile build profile, environment variables, and migration gate configuration.

##### **3.6.5 View Packets**

**3.6.5.1.2 Element Catalog**

_Table 20: Process Catalog_

| Process step | Artifact | Architecture purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Source change | apps/api, apps/web, apps/mobile, docs | Drives code and documentation evolution under one repository. |
| Validate workflow | .github/workflows/validate.yml | Runs lint, typecheck, high-severity audit, unit tests, build, `pnpm --filter=api run db:push`, and API e2e with PostgreSQL 18 and Redis 7 service containers. |
| Docker publication | .github/workflows/publish-docker.yml | Builds API and web Docker images using Buildx and publishes branch and short-SHA tags to GHCR. |
| Mobile packaging | .github/workflows/publish-mobile.yml | Produces an Android APK through `eas build --platform android --profile preview --local --non-interactive --output build.apk`. |
| Migration gate | Drizzle migration / push process | Ensures database shape matches the runtime image before release traffic; CD_GUIDE notes the current production API image should not be assumed to run migrations itself. |
| Runtime release | Render image-backed services | Pulls API/web images from GHCR, injects environment variables, connects to Postgres and Redis/Valkey; deploy hooks are documented target automation, not present in `ci.yml`. |

**3.6.5.1.2.1 Elements**

Elements are source code, GitHub workflows, validation steps, service containers, images, APK artifact, GHCR, migration gate, and Render services.

**3.6.5.1.2.2 Relations**

Relations include trigger, validation dependency, test-service dependency, artifact generation, registry publication, migration dependency, and runtime release dependency.

**3.6.5.1.2.3 Interfaces**

Interfaces include GitHub Actions workflow contracts, setup action inputs, pnpm/turbo commands, Docker build context, GHCR image tags, Render deploy hooks, and Drizzle database commands.

**3.6.5.1.2.4 Behavior**

The workflow validates source and database shape before artifact publication. Docker images and the mobile artifact are produced after validation. Runtime release consumes published images and environment configuration.

**3.6.5.1.2.5 Constraints**

Release artifacts must be produced from validated source. Database shape changes must be coordinated with runtime image rollout. Secrets must remain outside source and images.

**3.6.5.1.3 Context Diagram**

Figure 9 is the context diagram for the development/process packet. The distinguished scope is GitHub Actions plus release artifacts.

**3.6.5.1.4 Variability Mechanisms**

Workflow inputs, build matrix entries, environment variables, mobile build profile, and migration sequencing are variable.

**3.6.5.1.5 Architecture Background**

This packet realizes ADR-001 and ADR-008 and supports testability, maintainability, supportability, and security analysis results.

**3.6.5.1.6 Related View Packets**

Related packets: 3.2.5.1 for artifacts, 3.5.5.1 for runtime deployment allocation, 3.3.5.1 for database-shape ownership.

### **4 Relations Among Views**

Each view provides a different perspective and design handle on the same architecture. The views are not independent: logical contexts map to source modules, source modules map to data ownership, runtime scenarios use those modules and data stores, deployment allocates runtime components to nodes, and development/process flow produces the deployable artifacts.

#### **4.1 General Relations Among Views**

_Table 21: General Relations Among Views_

| Relation | Rule | Consistency check |
|---|---|---|
| Logical to Implementation | Every logical bounded context maps to a source module, source contract, or requirements-backed architecture contract. | Logical element catalog and Implementation element catalog share the same context names. |
| Logical to Data | Each bounded context owns a data group or an explicit external/provider-owned data relation. | Data Ownership Catalog assigns owner to every table group and Redis key group. |
| Logical to Runtime | Each runtime participant belongs to one logical context or external actor/provider. | Runtime Scenario Trace maps each flow to UCs, ADs, ADD scenarios, and ADRs. |
| Implementation to Data | Drizzle schemas and Redis repositories belong to source modules that own the corresponding data groups. | schema.ts exports module-owned schemas; Redis state is owned by use-case context. |
| Runtime to Data | Runtime flows mutate only data owned by the participating context or through an explicit port/event contract. | Checkout, ACL sync, compensation, and review packets list their interfaces and constraints. |
| Runtime to Deployment | Runtime behavior assumes shared PostgreSQL/Redis and provider access from every API instance. | Deployment packet includes managed PostgreSQL, managed Redis/Valkey, and providers. |
| Development / Process to Deployment | CI/CD produces the images and artifacts deployed by the runtime topology. | Development packet publishes API/web images to GHCR and mobile APK artifact. |
| ADR to Views | Every ADR appears in at least one view or relation. | Table 5 and view-packet architecture background sections reference ADR-001 through ADR-008. |
| Quality attributes to Views | Each quality attribute has a tactic and at least one architectural element. | Table 6 maps quality attributes to tactics, elements, and QA scenario IDs. |

#### **4.2 View-to-View Relations**

_Table 22: View-to-View Relations_

| From view | To view | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Logical | Implementation | Auth BC maps to Better Auth and auth schema; Catalog BC maps to restaurant-catalog; Ordering BC maps to ordering; Payment BC maps to payment; Promotion BC maps to promotion; Notification BC maps to notification; Image BC maps to image; Review and Governance map to SRS/ADD architecture contracts. |
| Logical | Data | Each BC owns its table group; Catalog emits snapshot events; Ordering and Notification own local ACL snapshots; Redis keys are owned by Ordering, Notification, or cross-cutting runtime policy. |
| Logical | Runtime | Runtime participants are instances of logical contexts: Checkout from Ordering, Payment from Payment, Promotion from Promotion, Notification from Notification, Review Eligibility from Review & Rating. |
| Implementation | Data | Drizzle schemas, repositories, schema.ts, and Redis repositories are the source units that access PostgreSQL and Redis groups. |
| Implementation | Development / Process | CI workflows validate source units and package API/web/mobile artifacts. |
| Runtime | Deployment | Sequence participants execute inside API runtime instances or external providers; shared state services make multi-instance behavior coherent. |
| Deployment | Development / Process | GitHub Actions and GHCR feed Render image-backed services and mobile APK publication. |
| Data | Deployment | PostgreSQL and Redis/Valkey are allocated as managed runtime services, reachable by API Instance 1, API Instance 2, and API Instance N. |

Known consistency status: target-only and planned elements are explicitly labeled in the views. Repository source remains authoritative for implemented modules, schemas, providers, workflows, and deployment artifacts; approved architecture documents remain authoritative for target contracts that do not yet have source modules.
