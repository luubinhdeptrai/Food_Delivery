/**
 * IOrderEligibilityPort
 *
 * Cross-BC port that allows the Review BC to verify order eligibility without
 * importing any Ordering BC schema, repository, or module internals.
 *
 * Architecture (ADR-007 — Ports and Adapters):
 *   - Defined here in shared/ports (neutral ground)
 *   - Implemented by OrderEligibilityAdapter in the Ordering BC
 *   - Consumed by SubmitReviewHandler in the Review BC via DI token injection
 *   - Pattern mirrors PAYMENT_INITIATION_PORT / PROMOTION_APPLICATION_PORT
 *
 * Dependency direction:
 *   Review BC  →  ORDER_ELIGIBILITY_PORT (shared interface)
 *                                 ↑
 *              OrderEligibilityAdapter (Ordering BC provides the binding)
 *
 * The port eliminates Review BC's direct coupling to the Ordering BC's
 * internal `orders` schema table and replaces it with an explicit capability
 * contract, consistent with the DIP applied elsewhere in the codebase.
 *
 * Phase: RV-2 (architecture hardening)
