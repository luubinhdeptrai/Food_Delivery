/**
 * Upload an image to Cloudinary and persist its metadata to the `images` table.
 *
 * Two phases:
 *   1. Direct upload — file goes browser → Cloudinary (signed). Required.
 *   2. Metadata persistence — POST /api/images so the `public_id` is tracked
 *      server-side. Best-effort: if the metadata call fails, the upload still
 *      succeeds (Cloudinary has the asset) but a warning is logged so we know
 *      orphan tracking failed for this asset.
 *
 * Why persist? The `images` table is the only place the `public_id` lives
 * canonically. Without it we can't programmatically delete unused assets later
 * (see CONTEXT.md rule 2 — Smart Image Cleanup).
